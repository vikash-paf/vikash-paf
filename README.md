## Greetings, Adventurer!

We don't hunt monsters—we hunt bugs.   
With test-driven development as our silver sword and refactoring as our Aard, we slay technical debt and purify code.   
Like Geralt, we prepare for every battle: tests are our potions, and reviews are our signs.   
Remember, no one walks the path alone—pull requests welcome, and merge conflicts must fall.  

- 💬 Ask me about go, python and sql databases.
